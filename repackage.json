 "description": "This is a version of the [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) library and python bindings with the ECW, FileGDB and MrSID plugins, precompiled for 32 and 64 bit python 2.7 on Windows. The package is derived from either Cristoph Gohlke's GDAL [Package](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal) (requires numpy 1.9x) or the [GIS Internals](http://www.gisinternals.com) GDAL core and python MSIs (requires numpy 1.7x). The ECW and MrSID plugins are extracted from [GIS Internals](http://www.gisinternals.com) ECW and MrSID installers. This package includes only the core GDAL library, no utilities or scripts (i.e. gdal_translate.exe, gdal_calc.py) are included.",
